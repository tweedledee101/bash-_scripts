Some useful bash scripts that I have made

**import_file.sh**
This file grabs your current directory, and then asks if you'd like to add a file from a different directory within your current directory. 

I aliased this script as "import". 
This is particularly useful when working with Windows. Linux is being ran as a subsystem on my computer, so this relieves multiple commands that I would normally have to do.
