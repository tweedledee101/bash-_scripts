# bash_scripts
Some useful bash scripts that I have made

**import_file.sh**
This file grabs your current directory, and then asks if you'd like to add a file from a different directory within your current directory. 

I aliased this script as "import". 
This is particularly useful when working with Windows. Linux is being ran as a subsystem on my computer, so this relieves multiple commands that I would normally have to do.

**export_github.py**
A nifty little tool I created to quickly export github files. 
- a couple of key things to note, it currently only runs Python and bash scripts, but can easily be configured to bring in any file format, just update the list that I have noted within my script. 
- I have not built in any methods to handle authentication - TO DO - 
- This currently only handles one file at a time, but will be updated again soon. - TO DO -
